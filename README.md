a. true. A Red Black Tree will never have any kind of 3-nodes chain, which means there will be no consecutive nodes with two red links between them.

b. true. Every path from a node to any of its leaves (NULL) in a Red Black Tree has the same number of black nodes. This property is known as the Black Height property and it ensures that the tree is balanced.

c. false. The maximum height of a Red Black Tree with n nodes is 2log(n+1), where log is the binary logarithm.

d. false. The path from the root to any leaf in a Red Black Tree has the same number of black nodes, but it can have any number of red nodes. However, the root node itself is always black, and every leaf node is black.

4.
a. Not sure, both are balanced trees, but they use different balancing criteria. AVL Trees are strictly balanced while Red Black Trees allow some imbalance

b. True, AVL Trees are generally more suitable for applications that require frequent insertions and deletions because they guarantee a more strictly balanced tree.

c. False, Both AVL Trees and Red Black Trees are deterministic data structures and will produce the same tree shape for the same set of keys and insertion order.

d. True, Both AVL Trees and Red Black Trees have a worst-case search time of O(log n), but AVL Trees have a slightly smaller constant factor, which may make them slightly faster for searching operations in practice.
